# Sigil-Codex
Sigil Codex is a Web3 dApp that lets users generate a unique rune-like symbol based on their wallet and Google identity. Each sigil is rendered visually from hashed wallet data and can be minted as an NFT on the Base network. The project explores the concept of identity and symbolism in a decentralized world.
