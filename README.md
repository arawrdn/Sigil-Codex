# Sigil Codex

**Mint your cryptographic symbol — your sigil of Web3 existence.**

Sigil Codex is an experimental Web3 project that fuses blockchain identity and symbolic art.  
Each user’s sigil is algorithmically generated from their EVM wallet address and Google account hash.  
Once generated, the sigil can be minted as an NFT on the Base network, stored forever as a proof of existence.

## Features
- Connect EVM wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Google Sign-In for identity binding
- Generate visual “sigil” from hashed data
- Mint the sigil as NFT (on Base)
- View public gallery of minted sigils

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + Canvas API
- Auth: Firebase Google Sign-In
- Smart Contract: Solidity (ERC-721)
- Network: Base mainnet
- Visual: Procedural shape generator
